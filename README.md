This repository is my personal **competitive programming arsenal**, showcasing solutions, templates, and optimizations built while practicing and competing on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). The structure is intentionally clean: `Contest/` stores contest-specific submissions, `Practice_800/`, `Practice_900/`, and `Practice_1000/` hold difficulty-based problem solutions, and `TLE Eliminator/` is my secret weapon with **fast I/O templates**, **utility snippets**, and **time-saving boilerplate** to avoid Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) in competitive environments. Written entirely in **C++** using **GCC/Clang** and developed in **Visual Studio Code**, this repo is a growing archive of problems solved using **greedy algorithms**, **binary search**, **dynamic programming**, **graph theory**, and other core techniques. My goal: solve **50+ problems per difficulty tier** before advancing, ensuring mastery over both speed and accuracy. To run any solution:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepak108-sudo/Codeforces.git
cd Practice_800   # or any folder
g++ solution.cpp -o solution
./solution
